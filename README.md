# EMCO Compact 5 PC Lathe - LinuxCNC - Fusion360
Configuration for Fusion 360 and LinuxCNC to control an EMCO Compact 5 PC lathe.

The EMCO Compact 5 PC was originally programmed and controlled using proprietary software that was licensed with a parallel port dongle. The goal of this project is to greatly improve the functionality by assembling the necessary instructions, configuration files and workflow processes to control the lathe using Fusion 360 and LinuxCNC
